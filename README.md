# GodotAIDetection
Godot AI player detection I made using RayCast2D. It's not complete and/or robust, but may be useful for some people.

I wanted to learn how to make an AI detect the player.
Made in more or less 3 hours, while experimenting with raycasts and vectors.

The important part is the DetectCast.gd script, you can copy the file and use in your project.
Just add it as a child node(class_name DetectCast) and config it through the exports and the parent node.
Use my project as a demo on how to use it.
